<b>The following code (single file) is for the Betelgeuse sign I came up with.</b>

<h2>Notes about the physical sign</h2>
The specifications for the sign itself (it's rough) can be found with this link:

The background lighting is provided by a white LED strip (300 LEDS) broken into 5 stripes.
The Marquis lights are LED bulbs in the shape of the old Edison lights (Amazon of course).
The LEDs are perfect for the solid state relays.

The arrow are small incadescent bulbs in a cadelobra base. The incadescent bulbs are the way
to go because they trail off when power is cut, so the arrow animation leaves a small trail.

<h2>Notes about control box</h2>

The control box is in a water proof enclosure. I'm running a few banks of solid state relays driven by
an arduino Mega (overkill), and the timing and on/off is controlled by the code in this project.
Except for the timing which required 5th grade math, everything else is mainly soldering and putting 
everything together.
